Here you can find the source code and compiled file for the LTS Utility Program.

LTS Utility for macOS lets you flash your ESP32 or Control Board with the newest version from GitHub. Using the web flasher at https://lts-design.com/pages/software is the preferred way if you're on Windows.

The LTS Control App can be downloaded from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/lts-control/id6742149969). An Android version is in early development. For now, you can use the Web version at the bottom of [this](https://lts-design.com/pages/software) page.
