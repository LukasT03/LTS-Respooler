## Filament Guide with ECAS04
This alternative for the Filament Guide adds an embedded mount for an ECAS04 bowden pneumatic fitting (compatible with 4 mm OD PTFE tube). This allows the PTFE tube to be mechanically locked to the guide, preventing it from coming loose during operation.

➡️ Available as a print profile on the MakerWorld page.

## Quick-Swap Spool Center
This add-on replaces the "Spool Center" part and allows for quick swapping between different holders for spools from different manufacturers.
