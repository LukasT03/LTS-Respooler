Here you can find the manufacturing data for all the available PCB boards. Feel free to order your own PCBs! They are optimized to be ordered from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) but are also available as shared projects on [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/project/member/?bmbno=7102E4BB-3522-48)

Only the Control Board V4 and the Driver Board V1 are still supported.
